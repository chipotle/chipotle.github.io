    <h2>Technical writing examples</h2>
    
    <p>I wrote, rewrote, or extensively edited all of this documentation. Note that while RethinkDB documentation has mostly remained static, Bixby documentation appears likely to change in the future, given reports of a pivot to a new LLM-driven Bixby revamp planned for 2025. I have added Wayback Machine links to relevant pages, indicated by “[Archive]”; if I catch an old page radically changing, I will remove the old link entirely and make an annotation.</p>
    
    <p>These are just representative samples. I wrote or edited most of RethinkDB&#8217;s documen&shy;tation, as I was the sole tech writer at the company; I was part of a three-person team at Samsung, and wrote a substantial portion of Bixby&#8217;s, particularly with respect to APIs and the proprietary development environment.</p>

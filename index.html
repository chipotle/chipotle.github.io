    <p>I’m a consulting technical writer working in Tampa Bay, Florida.</p>
    <p>▶︎ <a href="Watts_Martin_Resume_2024.pdf">Résumé</a> (PDF)

    <h2>Technical writing examples</h2>
    
    <p>I wrote, rewrote, or extensively edited all of this documentation. Note that while RethinkDB documentation has mostly remained static, Bixby documentation <em>may</em> change in the future, depending on how much effort Samsung continues to put into it. (I plan to update this page with PDFs or static web captures soon.)</p>
    
    <p>These are just representative samples. I wrote or edited most of RethinkDB&#8217;s documen&shy;tation, as I was the sole tech writer at the company; I was part of a three-person team at Samsung, and wrote a substantial portion of Bixby&#8217;s, particularly with respect to APIs and the proprietary development environment.</p>
